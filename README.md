# VoteKing üèÜ

## Project Description  
**VoteKing** is a straightforward and deployable Solidity smart contract designed for simple two-option voting. It allows users to cast a vote for one of two hard-coded options without needing to input any parameters. This makes it ideal for quick, permissionless voting scenarios or as a learning project for smart contract development.

## What it does  
The contract lets any Ethereum address vote exactly once ‚Äî either for Option A or Option B. It tracks how many votes each option has received, prevents double-voting from the same address, and provides a function to determine which option is currently leading (or if there‚Äôs a tie).

## Features  
- ‚úÖ Two fixed voting options: Option A & Option B  
- üó≥ Vote functions with **no input parameters** (`voteA()` and `voteB()`)  
- üõ° Prevents multiple votes from the same address via a `hasVoted` mapping  
- üìä Public vote counters (`votesOptionA` and `votesOptionB`) for transparency  
- üì£ Emits a `VoteCast` event each time a vote is cast, for off-chain monitoring  
- üîç A view function `getWinner()` returns the current leading option or ‚ÄúTie‚Äù  
- üéì Beginner-friendly Solidity version `^0.8.0` ‚Äî easy to read, deploy, and extend
